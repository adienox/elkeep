#+title: elkeep - Google Keep for Emacs
#+author: Adwait Adhikari

* Overview

=elkeep= is a bridge between Google Keep and Emacs that allows you to sync your Google Keep notes with your Org-mode workflow. It consists of two main components:

- =elkeep-cli.py= - A Python CLI tool for interacting with Google Keep
- =elkeep.el= - An Emacs package that integrates with Org-roam

The tool downloads Google Keep notes and converts them to Org-mode format, making them accessible within your Emacs environment and compatible with Org-roam for enhanced note-taking and knowledge management.

* Features

- List all notes from Google Keep
- Retrieve specific notes by ID
- Export journal entries to Org files
- Secure authentication token storage using keyring
- Convert notes to Org-mode format with proper metadata
- Integration with Org-roam for seamless note management
- Support for note labels as Org-mode tags

* Requirements

** Python Dependencies
- Python >=3.13
- =gkeepapi>=0.16.0= - Google Keep API client
- =keyring>=25.6.0= - Secure credential storage
- =pypandoc>=1.15= - Document conversion

** Emacs Dependencies
- Emacs >=27.1
- =org-roam>=2.0.0= - Note-taking and knowledge management
- =nano-read= - Enhanced reading interface

** System Dependencies
- =pandoc= - Document converter (required by pypandoc)

* Installation

** Python CLI Tool

The CLI tool is designed to be run with =uv= (recommended) or can be installed manually.

*** Using uv (Recommended)
The script includes inline dependency metadata and can be run directly:

#+begin_src bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x elkeep-cli.py

# Run with uv (dependencies will be automatically managed)
uv run elkeep-cli.py --help
#+end_src

*** Manual Installation
#+begin_src bash
# Install dependencies manually
pip install gkeepapi>=0.16.0 keyring>=25.6.0 pypandoc>=1.15

# Install pandoc (varies by system)
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install pandoc

# macOS:
brew install pandoc

# Run the script
python elkeep-cli.py --help
#+end_src

** Emacs Package

1. Add =elkeep.el= to your Emacs load path
2. Ensure dependencies are installed (org-roam, [[https://github.com/rougier/nano-read][nano-read]])
3. Configure the package in your Emacs configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package elkeep
    :ensure (:host github :repo "adienox/elkeep")
    :commands (elkeep-get-entries elkeep-save-journal)
    :custom
    (elkeep-journal-label "JOURNAL")
    (elkeep-exclude-labels '("JOURNAL" "NOSHOW"))
    (elkeep-notes-directory "/path/to/notes") ; e.g., org-roam-directory
    (elkeep-journal-directory "/path/to/journals") ; e.g., org-roam-dailies directory
    (elkeep-cli-bin "/path/to/elkeep-cli.py")) ; or just "elkeep-cli" if in PATH

#+end_src

* Usage

** CLI Tool

*** Authentication
First, you need to authenticate with Google Keep, to get the master token follow the below steps:

- Go to https://accounts.google.com/EmbeddedSetup
- Log into your Google Account
- Click on "I agree" when prompted. The page may show a loading screen forever; ignore it and move on to the next step.
- Obtain the value of the oauth_token cookie. For more details see the second way from [[https://github.com/rukins/gpsoauth-java/blob/b74ebca999d0f5bd38a2eafe3c0d50be552f6385/README.md#second-way][gpsoauth-java readme]].

#+begin_src bash
# Store your master token (you'll need to obtain this from Google Keep)
elkeep-cli.py -t YOUR_MASTER_TOKEN
#+end_src

*** List Notes
#+begin_src bash
# List all available notes
elkeep-cli.py -l
#+end_src

*** Get Specific Note
#+begin_src bash
# Download a specific note by ID
elkeep-cli.py -g NOTE_ID -o ./notes

# Download with custom title
elkeep-cli.py -g NOTE_ID -o ./notes -T "Custom Title"
#+end_src

*** Export Journal Entries
#+begin_src bash
# Export all journal entries to a directory
elkeep-cli.py -j ./journals -L JOURNAL
#+end_src

** Emacs Integration

Make sure to have =uv= installed as we use =uv= scripts to run the python script.

*** Interactive Functions

- =elkeep-get-entries= - Query Google Keep for notes and interactively select one to download
- =elkeep-save-journal= - Download and save journal entries to the configured directory

*** Example Workflow

1. =M-x elkeep-get-entries= - Browse and select notes from Google Keep
2. Selected notes are automatically saved to =elkeep-notes-directory=
3. Org-roam database is automatically synced after downloads
4. Use =M-x elkeep-save-journal= to batch download journal entries

* Configuration

** Emacs Customization Variables

- =elkeep-cli-bin= - Path to the elkeep-cli binary (default: searches PATH)
- =elkeep-notes-directory= - Directory for saving notes (recommend: =org-roam-directory=)
- =elkeep-journal-directory= - Directory for journal entries (recommend: org-roam dailies directory)
- =elkeep-journal-label= - Label to identify note as a journal entry
- =elkeep-exclude-labels= - Labels to exclude when showing notes

** Note Processing

- Notes are converted from Google Keep format to Org-mode using pandoc
- Each note gets a unique UUID in its PROPERTIES drawer
- Google Keep labels become Org-mode filetags
- Journal entries are treated specially (no tags added if JOURNAL label is present)

* Authentication & Security

- Authentication tokens are stored securely using the =keyring= library
- Tokens are automatically reused for subsequent API calls
- State is saved to avoid repeated authentication
- Default storage location: =$XDG_DATA_HOME/gkeep_state= or =$HOME/.local/share/gkeep_state=

* Troubleshooting

** Common Issues

*** "No module named 'gkeepapi'" Error
Make sure you have the required Python dependencies installed or use =uv run= to automatically manage dependencies.

*** Pandoc Not Found
Install pandoc on your system. The =pypandoc= Python library requires the pandoc binary to be available.

*** Emacs Integration Not Working
Ensure =elkeep-cli-bin= points to the correct script location and that it's executable.

** Debugging

- CLI processes create buffers like =*elkeep-cli-output*= and =*elkeep-get-entry*= for debugging
- Failed operations will display the process buffer with error details
